There exist numerous approaches to automated testing. Usually, the approaches selected depend on the system under test.
One commonly adopted strategy involves automating highly repetitive tests, allowing the manual QA team to allocate more time to tackle complex test cases and engage in exploratory testing. This approach optimizes the efforts of the team by automating repetitive tasks, freeing up valuable resources for more in-depth and exploratory testing activities.

There are several tools available for automated testing, depending on the specific needs and requirements of your project. Here are some popular tools for different types of automated testing:

Selenium: Selenium is a widely used open-source tool for web application testing. It provides a framework for writing automated tests in various programming languages such as Java, C#, Python, etc. Selenium WebDriver allows you to automate interactions with web browsers.

Appium: Appium is an open-source tool for automating mobile applications across different platforms, including iOS and Android. It supports various programming languages and allows you to write tests using standard automation APIs.

JUnit: JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java applications. It provides annotations and assertions for writing unit tests. JUnit can be integrated with build tools like Maven or Gradle and various development environments.

TestNG: TestNG is another testing framework for Java applications that offers more advanced features than JUnit. It supports functional, integration, and end-to-end testing and provides features like parallel test execution, data-driven testing, and test configuration through XML files.

Cucumber: Cucumber is a tool that supports behavior-driven development (BDD). It allows you to write tests in a human-readable format using Gherkin syntax. Cucumber tests can be written in various programming languages and can serve as living documentation for your application.

JMeter: JMeter is a popular tool for performance testing and load testing of web applications. It can simulate a large number of users and measure the performance of your application under different load conditions. JMeter supports various protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.

Postman: Postman is a widely used tool for API testing. It provides a user-friendly interface for sending HTTP requests, validating responses, and creating automated test scripts. Postman supports various authentication methods, testing environments, and integrations with other tools.

Cypress: Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It provides a simple and intuitive syntax for writing tests and offers features like automatic waiting, real-time reloading, and easy debugging.

Robot Framework: Robot Framework is an open-source, generic test automation framework that supports both web and mobile applications. It uses a keyword-driven approach and allows test cases to be written in a human-readable format. Robot Framework supports various test libraries and can be extended with custom keywords.

These are just a few examples of the many automated testing tools available. The choice of tool depends on your project requirements, programming language, and the type of testing you need to perform.

The automation test tools described above may be a great choice for your web-based project, but what implementing automation testing for mobile apps? Here are some nice testing tools according to the Katalon website.

The Katalon Platform - an all-in-one automation testing tool for mobile, web, API, and desktop (Windows).

Espresso - developed by Google, Espresso is also a test automation framework for This is a platform-specific solution with a flexible and straightforward API; however, it only runs Android UI tests and supports the enhancement of the functionalities.

XCUI Test - a product of Apple for iOS developers to script and run UI tests with Xcode IDE. This automation framework is solely for iOS devices and doesn’t support Android systems. 

Robotium - handles automated mobile testing for Android v1.6+ applications, both native and hybrid. The setup requires having Android SDK, Eclipse, Android Development Kit, and JDK ready.

Selendroid - native and hybrid Android apps as well as mobile web can be tested using this tool. With robust WebDriver API and Selenium integration, it eliminates the majority of the current obstacles.

iOS Driver - in comparison to real devices, this tool performs better on emulators. Using the Selenium/WebDriver API, iOS Driver can integrate iOS hybrid and native mobile apps with Selenium for testing.

Xamarin.UITest - this tool is used for creating and running UI acceptance tests across iOS and Android applications on mobile devices. It enables the testing of both Xamarin apps and native apps: Xamarin for iOS, Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android platform.
